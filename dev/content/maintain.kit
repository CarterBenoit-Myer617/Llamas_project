        <p>It might sound silly, but keep your llamas healthy. No amount of grooming can help an unhealthy llama shine.
            Feed your llamas a nutritious diet and provide them with proper care. This "grooming from the inside" will
            go a long way towards having llamas that look good on the outside. Llama grooming is very important, and it
            can also be a great way to bond with your llama.</p>
